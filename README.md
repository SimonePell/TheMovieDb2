This is a small replica of The Movied Databse, to work correctly you have to put your API key in TheMovieDb2/src/app/movie.service.ts
After saving your API key and typing in the terminal 'ng serve' u should see a link like 'http://localhost:4200/' (it might change on 
your machine), if u see a link like this u just have to put it into your brower, and then you see the front-end and some functions
that use APIs call, like the popular movie of the week, day, movie details and the search option.
